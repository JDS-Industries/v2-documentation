title: Renew SSL Certificate
---

## Option 1: Renewing an Existing License

1. Download Tomcat certificate through CA (GoDaddy). Be sure to choose Tomcat at download and extract zip file. There should be approximately 4 files to download. We are interested in the file that has the long alphanumeric file name with an extension of .crt.

2. Download <Link to="https://keystore-explorer.org/">KeyStore Explorer tool</Link> on your PC, if you don't already have it.

3. The keystore file is located in `C:/Program Files/mrc/development or production/m-power/tomcat/conf/tomcat.keystore`. Copy this file into the same location that you extracted the files from step 1.

4. Next, open Keystore Explorer and select the keystore from Step 3. The system will prompt you for the password. If you do not know it, you can go to the m-Power server and review the server.xml file in `\tomcat\conf`. Look for the value after the `keystorePass` attribute.

5. Once opened, your screen should look similar to the following:

6. Right click on `tomcat` and select Import CA -> From File

7. Enter the keystore password again.

8. Find the .crt file from step 1 with the long alphanumeric name and select it.

9. Confirm import and save file.

10. On the m-Power server, rename the existing keystore (for backup purposes).

11. Copy newly updated keystore back to server.

12. Restart Tomcat (windows service for dev and production)

13. Repeat steps 10-12 above for production.

## Option 2: Creating new keystore from scratch 

1. Open command line on server and enter this command to create keystore:
keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore tomcat.keystore

2. Enter in information. The First/Last name is really the address of your website. If using a wildcard, be sure to enter `*.jdsindustries.com`

3. After filling out the rest of the information, you are returned to a command line.

4. Next, create a CSR to send to GoDaddy by entering the following command:

  ```
  keytool -certreq -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -file csr.csr -keystore tomcat.keystore
  ```

5. Enter in password and a new file called csr.csr will be created. Send this file to GoDaddy.

6. Once GoDaddy verifies that this information is valid they will send you several files. 
  a. The file with “bundle” in the name is the root certificate.
  b. The file with “gdig” in the name is in the intermediate certificate.
  c. The file with the long alphanumeric name is your tomcat certificate.

7. Once all of these files and the keystore are in the same folder, run the following commands. **I always advise making a backup of your keystore file before continuing**
  a. keytool -import -alias root -file gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt -keystore tomcat.keystore
  b. keytool -import -alias intermediate -file gdig2.crt -keystore tomcat.keystore
  c. keytool -import -alias tomcat -file 

8. Once completed, you can open this new tomcat.keystore with KeyStore explorer to confirm that it was created successfully.

9. Copy this file onto your development server and restart Tomcat. Verify that Tomcat starts and that the certificate is loaded correctly. If so, repeat this step for production.
