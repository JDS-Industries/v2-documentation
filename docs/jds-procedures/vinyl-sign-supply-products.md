# Vinyl & Heat Transfer Sign Supply Products

Vinyl & heat transfer products have different SKU patterns that often require special programming. Each SKU pattern is typically made up of:

* Product series (or material) code
* Color code (typically a 3-digit number number)
* Width / Length / Height (which sometimes need to be translated)
* Other separators and codes, depending on vendor

## Product Images

To make life easier, these products share images based on series/material + color. The "Edit Product" tool automatically handles this when a user uploads an image 
to a SKU that matches one of the patterns shown below.

> Example code can be found in the `v2-express-api` project in the `checkIfSkuIsAVinyl` file in the `actions` folder.
