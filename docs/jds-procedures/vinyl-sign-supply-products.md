# Vinyl Sign Supply Products

Vinyl products have different SKU syntaxes that often require special programming. Each SKU syntax is typically made up of:

* Product series (or material) code
* Color code (typically a 3-digit number number)
* Width / Length / Height (which sometimes need to be translated)
* Other separators and codes, depending on vendor

## Example Code / RegExs

Code can be found in the `v2-express-api` project in the `checkIfSkuIsAVinyl` file in the `actions` folder.
